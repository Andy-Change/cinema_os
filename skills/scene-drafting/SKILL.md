# Scene Drafting Protocol

This skill transforms narrative concepts into structured, draft-ready scenes. It ensures consistency in tone, formatting, and character voice.

## Workflow

1.  **Reference Season DNA**: Read `output/seasons/<ID>/blueprints/season_dna.yaml` to ensure alignment with the overarching narrative arc.
2.  **Apply Blueprint**: Use the `references/templates.md` for proper sluglines and formatting.
3.  **Draft Dialogue**: Focus on subtext rather than exposition.
4.  **Visual Descriptions**: Keep them concise but evocative for the Visual Controller agent.

## Core Principles
- **Conciseness**: Avoid flowery language; focus on action and reaction.
- **Industry Standards**: Follow the standard screenplay format (Slugline, Action, Character, Dialogue).

## Resources
- See [templates.md](references/templates.md) for structural examples.
