# Brand Integration Strategy

This skill enables agents to weave external commercial entities into the story world without breaking immersion.

## Workflow

## Integration Levels
- **LEVEL 1 — ENVIRONMENTAL (80%)**: Clothing, background objects. (**Scene-first**)
- **LEVEL 2 — INTERACTION (15%)**: Subject uses the product. (**Scene-first + adaptation**)
- **LEVEL 3 — HERO ARTIFACT (5%)**: Product is the center of the scene. (**Artifact-first**)

## Integration Models
- **Model A (Scene-First)**: Story and aesthetics take precedence. Adapt brand to the world.
- **Model B (Artifact-First)**: Specific scene/micro-story engineered specifically for the brand's hero moment.

## Resources
- See [brand_values.md](references/brand_values.md) for definitions.
- Detailed logic in [prompt-structure.md](../../visual-prompting/references/prompt-structure.md).
