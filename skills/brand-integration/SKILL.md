# Brand Integration Strategy

This skill enables agents to weave external commercial entities into the story world without breaking immersion.

## Workflow

1.  **Identity Scan**: Load brand values from `references/brand_values.md`.
2.  **Context Matching**: Identify scenes where the brand naturally fits (e.g., a high-tech car in a neo-noir cityscape).
3.  **Subtle Weaving**: Focus on functional or aesthetic utility rather than "commercial" mentions.

## Core Principles
- **Immersion First**: The story takes precedence. If a brand feels forced, reject or modify the integration.
- **Visual utility**: Prioritize brands as part of the visual environment (Visual Ctrl agent's concern).

## Resources
- See [brand_values.md](references/brand_values.md) for specific brand definitions.
