# Commercial Strategy Skill

This skill automates the pricing of attention and cultural context within Cinema OS. It moves away from "cost per second" to **Value of Narrative Impact**.

## Pricing Metrics (The OS Cinema Standard)

1.  **Narrative Influence**: How much the brand affects the story arc.
2.  **Context Matching**: Synergetic value between the brand and the episode's subtext.
3.  **Visual Prominence**: Tier-based control (Ambient vs. Interaction vs. Hero).
4.  **Repeatability**: Frequency of appearance across the season.

## Automated Pricing Workflow

1.  **Analyze Request**: Check brand category and desired integration level (Tier 1-4).
2.  **Calculate Base**: Apply Tier pricing from [pricing-tiers.md](references/pricing-tiers.md).
3.  **Apply Multipliers**: Add category exclusivity and transmedia upsells.
4.  **Generate Offer**: Produce a formatted "Season Integration Proposal".

## Guidelines
- **Integrity Filter**: If the brand integration disrupts the [0] NARRATIVE CONTEXT of the episode, increase the price (Risk Premium) or reject.
- **Think Overlap**: Ensure brand presence doesn't conflict with "Think" layer prominence.
