# Commercial Strategy Skill

This skill automates the pricing of attention and cultural context within Cinema OS. It moves away from "cost per second" to **Value of Narrative Impact**.

## Pricing Metrics (The OS Cinema Standard)

1.  **Narrative Influence**: How much the brand affects the story arc.
2.  **Context Matching**: Synergetic value between the brand and the episode's subtext.
3.  **Visual Prominence**: Tier-based control (Ambient vs. Interaction vs. Hero).
4.  **Repeatability**: Frequency of appearance across the season.

## Automated Pricing Workflow

1.  **Analyze Request**: Check brand category and desired integration level (Tier 1-4).
2.  **Calculate Base**: Apply Tier pricing from [pricing-tiers.md](references/pricing-tiers.md).
3.  **Apply Multipliers**: Add category exclusivity and transmedia upsells.
4.  **Generate Offer**: Produce a formatted "Season Integration Proposal".

## Guidelines
- **Integrity Filter**: If the brand integration disrupts the [0] NARRATIVE CONTEXT of the episode, increase the price (Risk Premium) or reject.
- **Tier 3 Co-existence**: We can have up to two Tier 3 brands (e.g., Think + Partner). They must not compete for the same "Hero Moment" in a single scene.

## Human Participation Rules
We do not do personal PR. Humans can be Signals or Contributors, never Heroes.

### Formats
1.  **FORMAT A — CHARACTER**: Fictional role. **Cannot be bought**.
2.  **FORMAT B — CONTRIBUTOR** (Tier H2): Source of knowledge/experience. No visual dominance.
3.  **FORMAT C — SIGNAL** (Tier H1): Ambient presence. No plot influence.
4.  **FORMAT D — THEMATIC MIRROR** (Tier H4): Recurring archetype/function. Reflects the theme via short dialogue (questions/doubts). Never explains or teaches.

### Red Flags (Immediate Veto)
- Wants to play themselves.
- Demands recognizability or "expert" status.
- Mentions social media or personal projects.
- Wants to control representation.
