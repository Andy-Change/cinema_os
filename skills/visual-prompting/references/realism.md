# High-Fidelity Realism Protocol

Use this protocol for any **Close-up**, **Extreme Close-up**, or **Portrait** shot to ensure cinematic skin and eye realism.

## 1. Skin Micro-Detail Module
> "Enhance all facial imperfections with high-accuracy micro-detail: authentic pores, subtle texture variation, fine lines, micro-creases, natural asymmetry, faint scars, freckles, vellus hairs, and true surface irregularities. Strengthen realistic material response—matte vs. oily zones, natural specularity, and micro-shadows—without introducing smoothing, softening, or plastic artifacts. Correct only elements that appear broken or distorted, while preserving the subject’s identity. **KEEP the original colour grading exactly as it is.**"

## 2. Eye Fidelity Module
> "Enhance the eyes with high-fidelity micro-detail: crisp iris texture, natural radial patterns, subtle chromatic variation, and accurate subsurface light response. Refine eyelids, lashes, and tear ducts with anatomical accuracy—fine lash separation, natural moisture levels, micro-shadows, and realistic translucency. Preserve authentic asymmetry and avoid artificial glow, over-sharpening, or plastic shine. Correct only distorted elements. **KEEP the original colour grading exactly as in the input image.**"

## Usage Rule
Append these text blocks to the `[8] STYLE & QUALITY` section of the prompt when `shot_size` is "Close Up" or "Portrait".
