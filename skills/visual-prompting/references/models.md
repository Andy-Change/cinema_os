# Model-Specific Technical Guides

## 1. Midjourney (Artistry & Cinema)
- **Parameters**:
  - `--stylize 250`: High artistic influence.
  - `--chaos 15`: Subtle unexpectedness for creative spark.
  - `--style raw`: For literal interpretation (essential for photorealism).
  - `--ar 21:9`: Use for cinematic widescreen aspect ratio.
- **Strength**: Unrivaled lighting and texture.

## 2. Stable Diffusion (Control & Realism)
- **Weighting**: Use brackets `(word:1.5)` or triple brackets `(((word)))` to emphasize elements.
- **Negative Prompts**: Critical for quality. Always include broad negative embeddings or terms.
- **Strength**: High customizability and consistent character generation.

## 3. DALL-E 3 (Logic & Composition)
- **Adherence**: Perfect for complex scenes with multiple actors.
- **Descriptive Adjectives**: Use "tactile", "iridescent", "gritty" to push the engine.
- **ChatGPT Sync**: Ask ChatGPT to "Write a high-fidelity DALL-E 3 prompt for..." as a pre-step.
- **Strength**: Complex spatial relationships and text rendering.
