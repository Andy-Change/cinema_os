# Advanced Prompting Techniques

## 1. Chain-of-Thought (Visual Reasoning)
Instead of one prompt, break it down:
1. "Define the core subject and its emotion."
2. "Add the environment and its historical context."
3. "Apply cinematic lighting based on the noon-day sun."
4. "Combine into one final technical prompt."

## 2. Few-shot Prompting (Style Training)
Provide examples of successful prompts to set the tone:
- *Example 1 (Noir)*: "Gritty street, neon rain, noir style, rim lighting..."
- *Example 2 (Noir)*: "Dark alleyway, shadow play, 35mm film grain..."
- *Your Prompt*: [Apply the Noir logic to a high-speed chase]

## 3. Lighting Technicals
- **Rembrandt Lighting**: For dramatic character portraits.
- **Chiaroscuro**: For heavy contrast and mysterious moods.
- **Bounce Light**: For soft, naturalistic atmosphere in interiors.
