# Cinematic Visual Bible

This document contains professional cinematography standards for agents producing visual assets. Use these technicals to ensure "maximum cinematic quality" across all generated images.

## 1. Camera Framing & Shot Sizes
- **Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)**: For establishing massive scale or isolation.
- **Medium Long Shot (MLS)**: Knees-up, balancing character action with environment.
- **Cowboy Shot**: Mid-thigh up (tense, Western-style authority).
- **Extreme Close-Up (ECU)**: Intense focus on eyes, lips, or micro-details for emotional impact.
- **Over-the-Shoulder (OTS)**: Essential for immersive dialogue scenes.

## 2. Dynamic Camera Angles
- **Dutch Tilt (Canted Angle)**: Tilt the camera to show disorientation or chaos.
- **Worm's-Eye View**: Looking up from the ground for extreme power or vulnerability.
- **Low-Angle Hero Shot**: Camera below eye level to make subjects imposing.
- **Bird's-Eye View**: Directly overhead for strategic/god-like perspective.

## 3. Professional Lighting (Atmosphere)
- **Rembrandt Lighting**: High-contrast portraiture with a small triangle of light on the cheek.
- **Volumetric God Rays**: Visible shafts of light through mist/dust for epic drama.
- **Golden/Blue Hour**: Romantic vs. Serene ethereality.
- **Chiaroscuro**: Extreme play between light and deep shadows (Villenueve/Noir style).
- **Rim Lighting**: Lighting from behind to separate the subject from the background.

## 4. Lens Technicals & Focus
- **Anamorphic Lens**: Widescreen 21:9 aspect ratio, oval bokeh, and horizontal lens flares.
- **Telephoto Isolation (85mm/135mm)**: Compressed background, shallow depth of field (bokeh).
- **Deep Focus (f/11+)**: Keeping everything from foreground to background sharp (Kubrick style).
- **Tilt-Shift**: Creating a miniature/surreal model-like effect.

## 5. Compositional Patterns
- **Rule of Thirds**: Dynamic off-center placement.
- **Golden Ratio (Fibonacci)**: For "divine" natural balance.
- **Leading Lines**: Using environment architecture to guide the eye to the subject.
- **Symmetrical Centering**: For static, formal tension (Wes Anderson/Kubrick).

## 6. Camera Motion (Dynamic AI-Video)
Use these technical cues for AI-video generation and "Frame Acts":

### 6.1 Linear Movement
- **Dolly In/Out**: Physical camera movement towards/away from subject (Immersive scale).
- **Truck Left/Right**: Parallel sliding movement (Tracking a character).
- **Pedestal Up/Down**: Physical vertical shift (Revealing massive structures).

### 6.2 Rotational Movement
- **Pan/Tilt**: Rotating on a fixed axis (Following action).
- **Orbit (180°/360°)**: Arcing around a "Beacon" object/subject.
- **Roll**: Rotating the camera on its own axis (Disorienting dream logic).

### 6.3 Psychological & Focus Techniques
- **Rack Focus**: Shifting focus from Foreground to Background within a single shot.
- **Dolly Zoom (Vertigo Effect)**: Simultaneous Dolly-In + Zoom-Out (or vice versa). Creates background "breathing" while keeping the subject size constant.
- **Crane/Jib Shot**: Sweeping vertical and horizontal arcs for epic reveals.

### 6.4 AI-Video Formulas
- **Handheld/Cinema Verite**: Adding subtle jitter for realism.
- **Keyframe Transition**: IMAGE A -> [Movement Term] -> IMAGE B.

## 7. The Face Quality Protocol (Directives)
- **Front-Facing Faces**: When a character's face is the focal point and facing the lens, **ALWAYS prioritize Close-Up (CU)**. This ensures the AI allocates maximum pixel density to facial features, eyes, and skin texture.
- **Scale Balance**: Use Wide Shots (WS) for environment context, but switch to CU for emotional engagement.

## 8. Atmospheric Architecture (Villeneuve Style)
- **Monolithic Scale**: Use EWS with tiny characters vs. massive structures.
- **Volumetric Density**: Mist, haze, and "dust rays" are mandatory for depth.
- **Color Punch**: Monochrome palette + 1 contrasting color accent.

## 9. Motivated & Witness Camera Logic
- **Motivated Motion**: The camera is an extension of the character's eye. If the character looks, the camera pans. If the character runs, the camera trucks. Never move without a narrative trigger.
- **The Witness Point**: Fixed position in the environment, usually at human eye level, observing the scene like a bystander. No flashy moves, just pure framing.

## 10. Temporal Editing (Nolan Architecture)
- **Reverse Chronology**: Tell the story backward to mirror disorientation or memory loss.
- **Parallel Timelines**: Interweave multiple time scales (week/day/hour) converging on a single event.
- **Cross-Cutting for Tension**: Rapidly switch between timelines to build suspense and cognitive engagement.
- **Shepard Tone Principle**: Create endless escalation through editing rhythm (each cut feels more urgent than the last).

## 11. Subjective Sound Design (Nolan + Zimmer)
- **Character's Perspective**: Mix audio from inside the character's head, not for audience comfort. Dialogue can be muffled if it serves immersion.
- **Ticking Clock Motif**: Use persistent rhythmic elements (heartbeat, machinery, watch) to create relentless tension.
- **Music-Sound Fusion**: Blur the line between score and sound effects. Music should feel environmental, not decorative.
