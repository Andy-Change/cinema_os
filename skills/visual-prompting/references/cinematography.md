# Cinematic Visual Bible

This document contains professional cinematography standards for agents producing visual assets. Use these technicals to ensure "maximum cinematic quality" across all generated images.

## 1. Camera Framing & Shot Sizes
- **Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)**: For establishing massive scale or isolation.
- **Medium Long Shot (MLS)**: Knees-up, balancing character action with environment.
- **Cowboy Shot**: Mid-thigh up (tense, Western-style authority).
- **Extreme Close-Up (ECU)**: Intense focus on eyes, lips, or micro-details for emotional impact.
- **Over-the-Shoulder (OTS)**: Essential for immersive dialogue scenes.

## 2. Dynamic Camera Angles
- **Dutch Tilt (Canted Angle)**: Tilt the camera to show disorientation or chaos.
- **Worm's-Eye View**: Looking up from the ground for extreme power or vulnerability.
- **Low-Angle Hero Shot**: Camera below eye level to make subjects imposing.
- **Bird's-Eye View**: Directly overhead for strategic/god-like perspective.

## 3. Professional Lighting (Atmosphere)
- **Rembrandt Lighting**: High-contrast portraiture with a small triangle of light on the cheek.
- **Volumetric God Rays**: Visible shafts of light through mist/dust for epic drama.
- **Golden/Blue Hour**: Romantic vs. Serene ethereality.
- **Chiaroscuro**: Extreme play between light and deep shadows (Villenueve/Noir style).
- **Rim Lighting**: Lighting from behind to separate the subject from the background.

## 4. Lens Technicals & Focus
- **Anamorphic Lens**: Widescreen 21:9 aspect ratio, oval bokeh, and horizontal lens flares.
- **Telephoto Isolation (85mm/135mm)**: Compressed background, shallow depth of field (bokeh).
- **Deep Focus (f/11+)**: Keeping everything from foreground to background sharp (Kubrick style).
- **Tilt-Shift**: Creating a miniature/surreal model-like effect.

## 5. Compositional Patterns
- **Rule of Thirds**: Dynamic off-center placement.
- **Golden Ratio (Fibonacci)**: For "divine" natural balance.
- **Leading Lines**: Using environment architecture to guide the eye to the subject.
- **Symmetrical Centering**: For static, formal tension (Wes Anderson/Kubrick).
