# Denis Villeneuve Cinematic Codex

This codex defines the "High-Atmosphere / Low-Dialogue" style for OS Cinema production, incorporating the **Face Quality Protocol** for AI generation.

## 1. The Face Quality Protocol (CRITICAL)
To maximize AI fidelity:
- **Rule**: Every shot where a character is **front-facing (facing the camera)** MUST be a **Close-Up (CU)** or **Extreme Close-Up (ECU)**.
- **Reasoning**: AI models produce higher facial detail/texture density at close range.
- **Exception**: Use Wide Shots (EWS/WS) only for scale-driven scenes where the character's face is secondary to the environment.

## 2. Visual Composition
- **Scale Contrast**: Small human figures in oversized, brutalist, or monolithic architectures.
- **Oaxial Symmetry**: Centered characters, perfect horizontals, and vertical lines to create a sense of scale and "fate."
- **Empty Frames**: Large areas of "negative space" to emphasize isolation.

## 3. Lighting & Atmosphere
- **Material Light**: Light must feel physical—use mist, dust, sand, or heavy fog to create "thick" volumes of light.
- **Color Accentuation**: Use a desaturated/monochrome base (e.g., orange desert or blue night) with ONE sharp, conflicting color accent for drama.
- **Soft Shadowing**: Ambient, low-contrast lighting to create dread without glossy highlights.

## 4. Movement & Rhythm
- **Parallax Pan**: Slow horizontal pans where foreground objects move faster than background to emphasize depth.
- **Fatalistic Motion**: Extremely slow "push-ins" (Dolly In) that feel heavy and unavoidable.

## 5. Narrative Style (Meaning Owner)
- **Minimalist Dialogue**: Cut 50% of dialogue lines. Use silence and glances.
- **Information Puzzle**: Reveal plot points non-linearly through visual rhymes or flashbacks.
- **Suppressed Performance**: Characters should be emotionally restrained, making occasional outbursts more powerful.
